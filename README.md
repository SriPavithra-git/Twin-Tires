## üöÄ Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan

**Twin Tires** is planned as an all-in-one two-wheeler marketplace web platform designed to simplify the process of exploring, comparing, buying, and selling two-wheelers.  

We will not only meet the base requirements of the problem statement but also extend the solution by providing:  
- A **responsive and interactive UI** that adapts across devices.

2. **Backend Development (Spring Boot):**  
   - RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, vehicle listings, calculators, bookings, and accessories.  
   - Secure and scalable backend architecture with proper error handling.  

3. **Database Layer (MySQL):**  
   - Structured schemas to store user details, vehicle information, bookings, services, and accessories.  
   - Optimized queries for fast and reliable data retrieval.  

4. **AI Voice Assistant(operating website through voice instructions):** 
   - operating website through voice instructions in different languages and response back with same  language.
   - Integration of speech recognition and text-to-speech features.  
   - Multi-language support for navigation and action execution.  
   - Personalization of responses based on user behavior and history.  

5. **Integration & Testing:**  
   - Use Postman for API testing and validation.
